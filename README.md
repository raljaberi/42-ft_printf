# ft_printf  

**ft_printf** is a custom implementation of the standard `printf` function in C. This project, part of the 42 curriculum, focuses on variadic functions, formatted output handling, and low-level I/O operations. It supports format specifiers such as `%c`, `%s`, `%p`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, and `%X`, allowing formatted output without relying on the standard library's `printf`. The project enhances understanding of argument parsing and memory management while ensuring efficient printing of different data types.
